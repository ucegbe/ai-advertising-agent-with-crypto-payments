    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to build an **autonomous AI advertising agent** that can create complete marketing campaigns while automatically paying for premium services using cryptocurrency. By combining cutting-edge AI agent frameworks with blockchain technology, we create a system that operates independently in the digital economy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What This Notebook Demonstrates\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🤖 **Autonomous Agent Architecture**\n",
    "- Built using the **Strands AI framework** with Claude Sonnet 4\n",
    "- Integrated with **Coinbase AgentKit** for blockchain functionality\n",
    "- Capable of making independent decisions and executing complex workflows\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💳 **Crypto-Native Payments**\n",
    "- **X402 Payment Protocol**: Automatic micropayments for API services\n",
    "- **Base Sepolia Network**: EVM-compatible blockchain transactions\n",
    "- **USDC Payments**: Stable currency for predictable service costs\n",
    "- **Autonomous Wallet Management**: No human intervention required\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎨 **Premium Service Integration**\n",
    "- **AI Image Generation**: Creates custom visuals for ad campaigns\n",
    "- **Weather Data APIs**: Enables location and season-based targeting\n",
    "- **Payment-Gated Access**: Demonstrates real economic interactions\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 **Complete Campaign Creation**\n",
    "- **Multi-Platform Ads**: Social media, display, email, and print formats\n",
    "- **Dynamic Content**: Adapts messaging based on real-time data\n",
    "- **Visual Integration**: Embeds generated images into campaign materials\n",
    "- **HTML Output**: Produces ready-to-deploy advertising assets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Innovation: Economic Agency\n",
    "\n",
    "This agent represents a new paradigm where AI systems can:\n",
    "- 🏦 **Manage their own budgets** for operational expenses\n",
    "- 🛒 **Purchase services** needed to complete tasks\n",
    "- 🔄 **Optimize spending** based on campaign requirements\n",
    "- 📈 **Scale operations** without human financial oversight\n",
